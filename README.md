# Meeting Room Booking System

## Project Overview

This repository contains the work developed for the Meeting Room Booking System, created as part of the Project IV curricular unit in the 3rd year of the Graduation Degree in Informatics Engineering at the School of Technology and Management of the Polytechnique Institute of Viana do Castelo.

The main goal was to develop a web platform for booking room reservations and to enhance it with smart features, including an Artificial Intelligence system and decentralization capabilities. Significant progress was made in various areas including AI-driven recommendations and decentralization.

## Project Features

- **Web Platform for Room Booking**: A comprehensive system to manage room reservations.
- **AI Integration**: An AI-driven recommendation system to enhance user experience using Python, Flask, and Scikit-learn.
- **Decentralization**: Implementation of a decentralized booking system via Matrix.
- **TypeScript Migration**: Migrated to TypeScript to improve scalability and facilitate large-scale development.
- **Scheduled Tasks**: Cron jobs for automating system maintenance and updates.

## Technologies Used

- **Front-end**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Back-end**: Node.js, Express.js, Python, Flask
- **Database**: PostgreSQL
- **Communication Architecture**: Matrix
- **AI & Machine Learning**: Scikit-learn
- **Scheduling**: Cron
- **Testing**: Jest
- **Documentation**: Insomnia Documenter
